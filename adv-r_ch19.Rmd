# 19.2 cement

```{r}
cement <- function(...) {
  args <- ensyms(...)
  paste(purrr::map(args, as_string), collapse = " ")
}

cement(Good, morning, Hadley)
#> [1] "Good morning Hadley"
cement(Good, afternoon, Alice)
#> [1] "Good afternoon Alice"
```

This function `cement` quotes all of it's inputs, and then converts them to 
strings.

but it won't work when we want to use variables

```{r}
name <- "Hadley"
time <- "morning"

paste("Good", time, name)
#> [1] "Good morning Hadley"
```

For that we need to use the unquote operator !!:

```{r}
cement(Good, !!time, !!name)
```


It makes it so the time and name variables are evaluated before "entering" the
function
